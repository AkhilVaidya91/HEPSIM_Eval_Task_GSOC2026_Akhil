### Dataset Information

This directory contains the dataset used in the project. The dataset is in the form of .npz files.

1. QG_jets_1.npz
2. QG_jets_2.npz
3. QG_jets_3.npz
4. QG_jets_4.npz
5. QG_jets_5.npz

I've added these files to the .gitignore to prevent them from being tracked by git, as they are large and not necessary for version control.

The files can be found at: [Pythia8 Quark and Gluon Jets for Energy Flow Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3164691)
